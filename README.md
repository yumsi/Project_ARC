# Project_ARC

Bot instructions:
0. Download and install the chromedriver: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
    Change the path in the script to the installation location of the driver


1. Start the Updated_Visualiser script in another window.
2. Start the bot.
3. Fullscreen the chromedriver when it opens.
4. Leave it running for 10 minutes, depending on the dataset size (3 seconds per case, 195*3 ~ 600 = 10 minutes)
    Note: The bot takes screenshots, you cannot do anything else while running the bot, as it will block the chromedriver window.
